# 📄 Description - Exercise Statement

In a music group, there are different types of musical instruments: wind instruments, string instruments, and percussion instruments.

All instruments have attributes such as their name and price. Additionally, they have a method called `playInstrument()`, which is abstract in the `Instrument` class and must be implemented in the subclasses. When playing a wind instrument, the method should print: "A Wind Instrument is playing"; for a string instrument: ""A String Instrument is playing""; and for a percussion instrument: ""A Percussion Instrument is playing"".

The class loading process occurs only once. Demonstrate that class loading can be triggered by the creation of the first instance of the class or by accessing a static member of the class.

Research Java's initialization blocks and static blocks to understand this concept better.

# 💻 Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Static and Instance Initializers
- Console Output

# 📋 Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code
- Basic knowledge of Java and OOP principles

# 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <(https://github.com/IgnaSubirachs/S1.01.Inheritance_polymorphism.L1.EX1.git)>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd java-instruments
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
4. Ensure your IDE is set up with Java 8 or later.

# ▶️ Execution
1. Compile the Java files:
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   ```
2. Run the main class:
   ```sh
   java Main
   ```
3. Observe the console output to see how different instruments produce different sounds.



```


3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add new feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch-name`).
5. Open a Pull Request.

Feel free to improve the code, add new instrument types, or enhance the documentation!
